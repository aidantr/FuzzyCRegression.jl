# FuzzyCRegression.jl

Documentation for [FuzzyCRegression.jl](https://github.com/aidantr/FuzzyCRegression.jl), which implements the heterogeneous effects estimator from Lewis, Melcangi, Pilossoph, and Toner-Rodgers (2022).

Our approach is able to capture the full distribution of treatment effects and identify causal effects in panel settings with latent time-varying confounders when the unobserved heterogeneity has a group structure.
