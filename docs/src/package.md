# Examples

We now illustrate the FCR estimator through two examples.

We first consider the setting of [Bonhomme, Lamadon, and Manresa (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA15722) who consider wage determination with two-sided firm and worker heterogeneity.

Second, we use labor market transitions to classify workers into types, using the dataset of [Ahn (2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jae.2940).

## Example 1: firm effects


## Example 2: worker types
