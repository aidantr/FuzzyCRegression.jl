This makes it substantially faster than previous approaches, which require iteration over all possible groupings of units. While FCR remains quite efficient with large datasets, computation times for iterative algorithms become prohibitive.\nCustomizable: The “fuzziness” of the FCR groups is governed by the regularization parameter m, where group assignment becomes binary as m rightarrow 1. Choosing m allows the estimator to better accommodate the uncertainty of group membership in realistic datasets, where noise means that cluster membership cannot be ascertained with certainty. Moreover, it means that FCR can recover the full distribution of effects.\nInference: Since FCR is a GMM problem, it's asymptotic properties follow from standard theory and we are able to derive analytic standard errors.
